;;; fixed-pitch-whitespace-mode.el --- Enable fixed-pitch whitespaces in a buffer   -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; TODO
;; [Done(Maybe?)] [Needs improvement]It triggers gc too frequently.  Maybe it could use
;; a face appending instead of checking for whether it is in block or something
;; to not font look it, as it reduces height further by accumulating the height
;; specification from other faces.

;; [Fixed] turning on/off takes too long and to be lazily loaded by jit-lock,
;; but still needs to optimize for re-search, it takes time the same O(n), so
;; when scrolling fast for the first time after turning on/off the mode, it's a
;; bit laggy.  It's solved by replacing to check each line is in a block that
;; has fixed-pitch font or not by instead checking each line is in fixed-pitch
;; font, this is much faster.  [Note] This way, we probably laterly have to remove two
;; matchers into one, since there's no need todifferentiate the work on org-mode
;; and other modes.

;; Requried by `buffer-face-mode'.
